                <h2>how to be more sustainable with / clothing </h2>
                <p>Fast fashion has flooded our consignment and Goodwill stores. Clothes that are meant to be worn once just cannot continue to be impressed on our society. In April 2013, a factory named the Rana Plaza <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Dhaka_garment_factory_collapse" target="_blank">Rana Plaza</a></b>.and it’s entire structure collapsed killing 1,134 and injuring 2,500. The factory made garments for brands such as : Benetton, Prada, Gucci, Mango, and Walmart. Most of the victims were women, along with a number of their children who were in the building’s corresponding nursery. The demand for clothing and the unethical practices of code carried out through the building is what lead to its demise. Something that we can all truly learn from. Fortunately, there are many different sources that list companies with sustainable / ethical business models. Clothing brands are now focusing more on their ethical and sustainable practices. The most well known brands that don’t skimp on style are : Pact, Reformation, and Everlane.

                <h2>how to be more sustainable with / gifting </h2>
                <p>Gift giving can be stressful, not only as the gift giver, but as the receiver. Before, when gifts were sought after as special and people weren’t collecting things in the masses like they are today, gift giving was a pleasure. Yet, the overwhelming nature of the urge and need to buy things we don’t need, and in excess has truly over taken our lives. If you are fresh out of ideas to give or receive, why not purchase a fair-trade gift for a friend – or better, yet a gift that gives back. There are certain shops that make it a point to sell curated and ethical pieces from artisans all over the world. Some of the most well-known and trusted sources are : The Little Market, Thrive Market, and Done Good. Lauren Conrad and partner created the Little Market in an effort to give power back to women who create for a living. Their site sells hand-made products and strives to practice fair trade principals. Thrive Market is an online market for natural bath and cleaning products, as well as wine and coffee. This site is known as a one-stop-shop for all thing fair-trade gifts. Lastly, Done Good is basically your search engine for products that want to do good. They have listings for over 3000+ brands that are ethically and sustainably sourced.
