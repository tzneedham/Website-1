            <h2>how to be more sustainable with / cosmetics </h2>
                <p>The health and beauty industry have made great strides recently in their environmental efforts. Even a couple short years ago it was extremely hard to get your hands on products that weren’t tested on animals, let alone have packaging that has any sort of sustainable elements. The Good Trade has listed their top picks for environmentally conscious brands, with the top competitors being : Credo Beauty, Love goodly, and Follain. Each of these companies have clean beauty standards and are proud to have some of the highest safety and sustainability standards in the industry. Credo specifically, seeks out each brand they carry through research and field testing. They also make it a point to be as transparent as possible with the ingredients they put in their products – a newer standard compared to even a few short years ago. Love Goodly, isn’t your average subscription box. They had-pick each item with intention. All of their picks are always non-toxic, cruelty, and vegan free. Follain also has strong standards, back by their team of scientists and research professionals. With a tagline that reads “no compromises allowed”, I think you’re guaranteed to experience a great – stigma free product. For more information on these and other sustainable / non-toxic brands, click <b><a href=" https://www.thegoodtrade.com/features/one-stop-shops-for-sustainable-beauty-and-skincare" target="_blank">here</a></b>.

                <h2>how to be more sustainable with / daily self-care </h2>
                <p>Similar to the food packaging industry, toiletries also their packaging also contribute to the growing build up we’re experiencing in our nations landfills. Yet, there are many ways a small shift in mind-set can make a large impact. For example, trading in those all-plastic shampoo bottles you replace at least twice a week can easily be swapped out with a shampoo bar. Not only are they rid of plastic, they don’t leak in your bag when you travel. If you aren’t ready to make the jump to the bar yet, there are options such as Plaine bottles that can be refilled in a vegan shampoo bottle. The plastic and bristles from toothbrushes carry a huge burden on our planet, and unfortunately sometimes in our seas. Bamboo toothbrushes with plant based bristles are the way to go. And lastly, swapping those makeup wipes with cloth rounds can make a huge impact in your daily carbon footprint. The styles and texture can range, and are easy to simply toss in the wash to reuse.
