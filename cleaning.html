                            <h2>how to be more sustainable with / daily cleansers </h2>
                <p>Hand soaps, dish-washing bottles, lotions, and other routine self cleaning products are largely only made of plastic. Cutting back on the amount of plastic bottle usage is one of the easiest ways to decrease your carbon footprint multiple times, daily. In addition to beauty products, daily cleansing products such as hand soaps, dish washing soap, and lotions can come in a subscription service as well. There are man companies to choose from, depending on your sustainability commitment. Specifically, Grove Collaborative not only tests every product they sell, they inspect the ingredients and the supply chain – yet their effort to send and packaged their products don’t necessarily have a zero waste effort. Clean Cult is another subscription based company that has recently leaned into their environmental efforts by packaging their products in paper-based milk cartons, and 100% plastic-free paper mailers. Cutting out plastic spray bottles isn’t the only way you can make a large impact on the environment. Using sponges and other abrasive materials for cleaning break down once they are thrown away and can end up in the wildlife we live and potentially eat. Sponges and daily cleansers with micro beads can easily be replaced with natural walnut based, or other plant based products, that work just as well.

                <h2>how to be more sustainable with / house-hold cleaning</h2>
                <p>There are many different products offered now that not only clean your home just as well as any grocery store product, they are eco-friendly too. Green cleaning products are free of naturally derived, non-toxic and biodegradable ingredients. They are also made using sustainable manufacturing practices. Now, there are many options that offer refillable glass bottles, to also aid in the over use of plastic bottles. Some of the top rated brand are : Common Good, Better Life, and Seventh Generation. Common Good not only offers refillable packaging, they use 100% essential oils and are sustainably sourced – not to mention their branding is pretty legit. Better Life focuses more on recycled / biodegradable packaging, and solar energy. Better Life was founded by two fathers who sought out to offer toxic-free products that were safe to use around their families. Seventh Generation is probably the most well-known of the three. They use only recycled packaging, and sustainable sourcing. In addition to making detergents, all-purpose cleaners, and wipes – they make free and clear diapers, tampons, and wipes.
