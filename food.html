                <p>It’s easy to get caught up in the fast pace of life and forget your re-usable bags, but there are also other elements to being sustainable when shopping for food. In addition to plastic bags, unsustainable food sources that go beyond their biological limits, can and are causing just as much of a threat to our planet. One of the main ways you can hone your sustainability it to be in-tune to where, when, and how your food is actually delivered to your store. For example, buying meat and dairy from pastured sources is ideal. Don’t be afraid to ask your butcher or farmer if the animals were pasture-raised. Additionally, look for seafood that are certified by organizations like the <b><a href="https://www.parents.com/recipes/scoop-on-food/how-to-be-a-more-sustainable-grocery-shopper/" target="_blank">Marine Stewardship Council</a></b>. The MSC makes sure that their seafood is fish / farmed that has less of a environmental impact. Buy more (seasonal) fruits and vegetables in general – as CO2 omissions from livestock accounts for about 3.1 percent of the US anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions expressed as carbon dioxide <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production" target="_blank">source</a></b>.
